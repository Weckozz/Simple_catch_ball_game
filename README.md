# Simple_catch_ball_game
This is a simple ball game program written by Kotlin. You mouse can control the blue paddle horizontally to catch the falling ball, and your score is shawn at the top of the screen. 
This program mainly uses the following functions: 1. remember{ mutableStateOf(...) } (It's used to store the state of the values) 2. LaunchedEffect(Unit) { ... } (It's used for animation loops and delay operations) 3. drawCircle(color, radius, center) (used to draw the circle/ball) 4. drawRect(color, topLeft, size) (used to draw the rectangle/paddle)  5. pointerInput(Unit) { detectDragGestures { change, dragAmount -> ... } } (used to detect the dragging gestures and update the location of paddle)  
This program mainly uses the following UI components: 1. Box(modifier = ...) {...}  2. Canvas(modifier = ...){...} (used to draw graphics)(If you need to change the background color, never add .background() to the modifier of Canvas. Add it to the modifier of Box is correct.)  3. Text(text = ..., modifier = ..., fontSize = ..., color = ...)
This program may be useful for us to learn the basis of Android development, so I just store it on Github in order to check it at any time in the future.
